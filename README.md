- Hi, I’m @Ranchonyx
- I’m mostly interested in backend development
- I have a particular fondness for computer languages/formal languages and parsing them
- I’m looking for genuinely intersting stuff to work on
- Repetetive tasks are the bane of my existence
- If you want to contact me, I am available via E-Mail exclusively
