- I enjoy backend development
- I have a mild fondness for parsing computer languages
- I mess around with Websockets on occasion
- I dislike UI development
- Despite all of that, I am employed as a full-stack developer
- Repetetive tasks are the bane of my existence
- If you want to contact me, for some reason unbeknownst to me, I am available via E-Mail exclusively
